InsightForge

InsightForge is a consulting-grade analytics platform that uses grounded generative AI to explain why business metrics change — with evidence, transparency, and trust.

Unlike traditional dashboards that only show what happened, InsightForge’s DecisionLens engine analyzes Year-over-Year performance, customer behavior, seasonality, and forecasts to deliver clear, quantified explanations backed by your actual data.

Every answer is:

Evidence-backed (numbers, filters, timeframes always shown)

Explainable (ranked drivers, quantified impact, no black boxes)

Governed (read-only data access, strict scope, confirmation required)

Business-safe (correlation-aware language, uncertainty stated explicitly)

InsightForge is designed for executives and business leaders who want answers they can trust, not AI-generated guesses.

What InsightForge Delivers

Explainable YoY analysis (“Why did sales drop?”)

Customer cohort insights (new vs returning behavior)

Seasonality-aware explanations

Forecasts with clear assumptions

What-if scenarios for decision support

Executive-ready summaries with recommended actions
